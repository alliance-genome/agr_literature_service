# This is a base script to look at and copy/paste to command line.
# It has manual steps in so not easy to automate.
# Here i am creating a new database literature_subset which is a subset of
# the database literature-test (on the same sql instance
# but in theory that shuld not matter but the connections would have to be changed)

To see the triggers for a database:-
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers;

To see the list of stored procedures:-
   \df

To see how to run the make_subset.py script use --help :-
   python3 make_subset.py --help
