    "abstract": "Onchocerciasis, also known as the African river blindness, is the second most important cause of infectious blindness worldwide after trachoma. It is caused by the filarial nematode, <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>, and transmitted by repeated bites of the vector, female black fly of the genus <i>Simulium damnosum</i>. The vector breeds in fast-flowing and oxygen-rich rivers in affected areas with transmission and disease prevalence usually stretching along these river basins and thereby the name river blindness.[1]\u00a0Aside from blindness, onchocerciasis results in a troubling chronic dermatitis.[1]",
