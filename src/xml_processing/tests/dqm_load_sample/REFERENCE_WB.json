This is an undivided, anucleated cytoplasmic mass placed in the central part of the ovary. Electron microscopy shows that, at first, in the gonial region, it is made of two branches which infiltrate themselves between the oogonia and then converge in a single axial column. Afterwards, this column will be pushed to the outside of the gonad and will disappear when the great oocyte increase takes place. Until then, the rachis is limited by its own envelope and connects each germinal cell through a pore present in the double layered membrane. The cytoplasmic bridge established between the oogonia and the rachis, the presence of a typical Golgi apparatus and of numerous mitochondria in the rachis strongly suggest that the rachis plays a role in the oocyte",

The perinuclear formations, detectable as early as germigene, remained until full ooplasmic growth.

In the pachytene stage, the complex has a typically classic organization. At the separation phase, the complex persists in certain places, in the diplotene stage and even in early diakinesis. These zones which persist during separation of the homologous chromosomes are believed to correspond to chiasma. This interpretation therefore implicates the complex in the recombination mechanism.",

In this study the responses of dauerlarvae to thermal stress and oxygen deprivation are investigated. Oxygen consumption of dauerlarvae is less sensitive to temperature change than that of adults, with Q10 values of 1.7 and 2.6 respectively. The upper thermal tolerance limit of dauerlarvae is also different from that of adults; dauerlarvae survive approximately three times longer than adults when exposed to 37C. In addition to differences in thermal tolerance, dauerlarvae surrvive longer under anaerobic conditions than adults, 7 days and 2 days respectively. On recovery from anaerobic stress dauerlarvae exhibit behavior changes which are suggestive of emergence from the dauerlarval stage. The responses of dauerlarvae to thermal stress and oxygen deprivation appear to be important aspects of the specialization for survival",

            "abstract": "Mechanotransduction is the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into a biological                response and constitutes the basis for a plethora of fundamental biological                processes such as the senses of touch, balance and hearing and contributes                critically to development and homeostasis in all organisms. Recent, genetic and                electrophysiological studies have shown that specialized macromolecular complexes,                encompassing mechanically gated ion channels, play a central role in the                transformation of mechanical forces into a cellular signal, which takes place in                mechanosensory organs of diverse organisms. These complexes are highly efficient                sensors, closely entangled with their surrounding environment. Such association                appears essential for proper channel gating, and provides proximity of the                mechanosensory apparatus to the source of triggering mechanical energy. Genetic and                molecular evidence collected in model organisms such as the nematode worm                    Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila                    melanogaster and the mouse highlight distinct classes of mechanically                gated ion channels and interacting molecules, which are likely parts of the                mechanotransducing apparatus. In this article, we review the progress towards                deciphering mechanotransduction in C. elegans. The exceptional                amenability of this simple worm to genetic and molecular manipulations has                facilitated the dissection of a metazoan mechanotransducer complex to unprecedented                detail.",

            "abstract": "The goal of the Gene Ontology (GO) project is to provide a uniform way to describe the functions of gene products from organisms across all kingdoms of life and thereby enable analysis of genomic data. Protein annotations are either based on experiments or predicted from protein sequences. Since most sequences have not been experimentally characterized, most available annotations need to be based on predictions. To make as accurate inferences as possible, the GO Consortium's Reference Genome Project is using an explicit evolutionary framework to infer annotations of proteins from a broad set of genomes from experimental annotations in a semi-automated manner. Most components in the pipeline, such as selection of sequences, building multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, retrieving experimental annotations and depositing inferred annotations, are fully automated. However, the most crucial step in our pipeline relies on software-assisted curation by an expert biologist. This curation tool, Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool (PAINT) helps curators to infer annotations among members of a protein family. PAINT allows curators to make precise assertions as to when functions were gained and lost during evolution and record the evidence (e.g. experimentally supported GO annotations and phylogenetic information including orthology) for those assertions. In this article, we describe how we use PAINT to infer protein function in a phylogenetic context with emphasis on its strengths, limitations and guidelines. We also discuss specific examples showing how PAINT annotations compare with those generated by other highly used homology-based methods.",
