    "abstract": "The 11q23 of the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (<i>MLL1</i>) gene plays a crucial role in early embryonic development and hematopoiesis. The <i>MLL-AF9</i> fusion gene, resulting from chromosomal translocation, often leads to acute myeloid leukemia with poor prognosis. Here, we generated a zebrafish model expressing the human <i>MLL-AF9</i> fusion gene. Microinjection of human <i>MLL-AF9</i> mRNA into zebrafish embryos resulted in enhanced hematopoiesis and the activation of downstream genes such as <i>meis1</i> and <i>hox</i> cluster genes. Embryonic MLL-AF9 expression upregulated HSPC and myeloid lineage markers. Doxorubicin and MI-2 (a menin inhibitor) treatments significantly restored normal hematopoiesis in MLL-AF9-expressing animals. This study provides insight into the role of MLL-AF9 in zebrafish hematopoiesis and establishes a robust and efficient in vivo model for high-throughput drug screening.",
