This is an undivided, anucleated cytoplasmic mass placed in the central part of the ovary. Electron microscopy shows that, at first, in the gonial region, it is made of two branches which infiltrate themselves between the oogonia and then converge in a single axial column. Afterwards, this column will be pushed to the outside of the gonad and will disappear when the great oocyte increase takes place. Until then, the rachis is limited by its own envelope and connects each germinal cell through a pore present in the double layered membrane. The cytoplasmic bridge established between the oogonia and the rachis, the presence of a typical Golgi apparatus and of numerous mitochondria in the rachis strongly suggest that the rachis plays a role in the oocyte",

The perinuclear formations, detectable as early as germigene, remained until full ooplasmic growth.

These zones which persist during separation of the homologous chromosomes are believed to correspond to chiasma. This interpretation therefore implicates the complex in the recombination mechanism.",

In this study the responses of dauerlarvae to thermal stress and oxygen deprivation are investigated. Oxygen consumption of dauerlarvae is less sensitive to temperature change than that of adults, with Q10 values of 1.7 and 2.6 respectively. The upper thermal tolerance limit of dauerlarvae is also different from that of adults; dauerlarvae survive approximately three times longer than adults when exposed to 37C. In addition to differences in thermal tolerance, dauerlarvae surrvive longer under anaerobic conditions than adults, 7 days and 2 days respectively. On recovery from anaerobic stress dauerlarvae exhibit behavior changes which are suggestive of emergence from the dauerlarval stage. The responses of dauerlarvae to thermal stress and oxygen deprivation appear to be important aspects of the specialization for survival",
