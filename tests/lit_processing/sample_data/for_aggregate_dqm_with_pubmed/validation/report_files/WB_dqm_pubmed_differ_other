dqm and pubmed differ	abstract	21413221	This book is part of an on-going series presenting collections of original research papers and literature reviews on diverse topics in molecular and cellular biology. This volume houses 34 literature reviews and research summaries on various aspects of the biology of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode of extraordinary usefulness as a research model. Topics include: the genome, mutation, transcription and its regulation, sex determination, male development, nervous system patterning, feeding and defecation, neural plasticity, and evolution. Appendices house a list of characterized genes, on-line resources, and other information. The text is illustrated, indexed, and includes a common bibliography of over 2000 literature citations.	Why should one study a worm? This simple creature is one of several “model” organisms that together have provided tremendous insight into how all organisms are put together. It has become increasingly clear over the past two decades that knowledge from one organism, even one so simple as a worm, can provide tremendous power when connected with knowledge from other organisms. And because of the experimental accessibility of nematodes, knowledge about worms can come more quickly and cheaply than knowledge about higher organisms.
