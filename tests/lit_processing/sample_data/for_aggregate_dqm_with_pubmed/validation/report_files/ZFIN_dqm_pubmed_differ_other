dqm and pubmed differ	abstract	30110134	Recent studies suggest that malignant melanoma heterogeneity includes subpopulations of cells with features of multipotent neural crest (NC) cells. Zebrafish and mouse models have shown that reactivation of neural crest-specific pathways during transformation determines the invasiveness of melanoma cells. In this study, we show that the neural crest-associated transcription factor FOXD1 plays a key role in the invasion and the migration capacities of metastatic melanomas both in vivo and in vitro. Gene expression profiling analysis identified both an upregulation of FOXD1 in NC and melanoma cells, as well as a downregulation of several genes related to cell invasion in FOXD1 knockdown cells, including MMP9 and RAC1B. Furthermore, we demonstrate that knockdown of RAC1B a tumor-specific isoform of RAC1, significantly impaired melanoma cell migration and invasion and could abrogate enhanced invasiveness induced by FOXD1 overexpression. We conclude that FOXD1 may influence invasion and migration via indirect regulation of MMP9 and RAC1B alternative splicing in melanoma cells. This article is protected by copyright.

dqm and pubmed differ	abstract	21873635	The goal of the GO Reference Genome Project, described in PMID 19578431, is to provide accurate, complete and consistent GO annotations for all genes in twelve model organism genomes.To this end, GO curators are annotating evolutionary trees from the PANTHER database with GO terms describing molecular function, biological process and cellular component. GO terms based on experimental data from the scientific literature are used to annotate ancestral genes in the phylogenetic tree by sequence similarity (ISS), and unannotated descendants of these ancestral genes are inferred to have inherited these same GO annotations by descent. The annotations are done using a tool called PAINT (Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool).
url: http://gocwiki.geneontology.org/index.php/PAINT	The goal of the Gene Ontology (GO) project is to provide a uniform way to describe the functions of gene products from organisms across all kingdoms of life and thereby enable analysis of genomic data. Protein annotations are either based on experiments or predicted from protein sequences. Since most sequences have not been experimentally characterized, most available annotations need to be based on predictions. To make as accurate inferences as possible, the GO Consortium's Reference Genome Project is using an explicit evolutionary framework to infer annotations of proteins from a broad set of genomes from experimental annotations in a semi-automated manner. Most components in the pipeline, such as selection of sequences, building multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, retrieving experimental annotations and depositing inferred annotations, are fully automated. However, the most crucial step in our pipeline relies on software-assisted curation by an expert biologist. This curation tool, Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool (PAINT) helps curators to infer annotations among members of a protein family. PAINT allows curators to make precise assertions as to when functions were gained and lost during evolution and record the evidence (e.g. experimentally supported GO annotations and phylogenetic information including orthology) for those assertions. In this article, we describe how we use PAINT to infer protein function in a phylogenetic context with emphasis on its strengths, limitations and guidelines. We also discuss specific examples showing how PAINT annotations compare with those generated by other highly used homology-based methods.
